------- Intro -------

JCombo attempts to offer an easy and flexible method of integrating
server-side and client-side logic. JCombo is designed to work with just about any web application architecture such as MVC, MVP, MVVM...

JCombo bridges the server and client layers through 'server interfaces' which allow data that are stored on the 
server-side to be easily retrieved and manipulated in JavaScript. These interfaces can also allow the developer to
make client-side use of functionality that is otherwise exclusive to the serverside (E.g. Tracking sessions, creating files on the server, etc...)

Effectively, server interfaces offer client-side developers a layer of abstraction when dealing with underlying server-side functionality.
